CS493 Syllabus
========

The class syllabus lives here. Make sure to watch this repository so you can be notified if things change. You can click the little eye at the top of the page to change your settings so you receive email notifications if things change. This class is highly experimental in its techniques and class structure, but is actually very modern in its approach to using the current and respected tools of the day for efficient and maintainable software engineering practices. Below you will find the meta about the class as well as a tentative schedule of assignments and tests. Happy Coding!

## Class Structure

The bulk of this class will be entirely run on the GitHub platform. GitHub is a social coding tool that emphasizes Open Source and creative collaboration. GitHub is built entirely off of the [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) distributed version control platform. Git is used in development teams around the world for maintaining code bases in an extremely efficient manner, as well as being a tool for pushing code to production servers and maintaining a record of pushes to track down and eliminate bugs before they become a problem.
